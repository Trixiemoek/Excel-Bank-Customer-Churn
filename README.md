# ANALYSIS OF BANK CUSTOMER CHURN USING EXCEL

## Business   Problem

Customer churn analysis addresses the need to understand and mitigate customer attrition. Customer churn, or the rate at which customers stop using a company's products or services, 
is a significant concern for businesses across various industries. High churn rates can lead to decreased revenue, reduced market share, and increased costs associated with acquiring new customers to replace those lost.

Identifying the factors contributing to customer churn and predicting which customers are at risk of leaving allows businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers. 
By addressing underlying issues, improving customer experience, and implementing targeted retention strategies, businesses can reduce churn rates and increase customer loyalty and profitability.

Therefore, the primary business problem addressed by customer churn analysis is how to minimize customer attrition and maximize customer retention to sustain and grow the business.
